## Mechanics of Game
--------------------

The first step that was taken in this project was creating the game itself in the javascript side of things 

The 'weapons' are defined as an array of 3 different strings, but they could be numbers if you prefer. 
As long as each element of the array is different it doesn't matter. 
I went with strings that described the 'weapons' in the war of the memulation.
Here's the code snippet below showing this process.

`const weapon = ["rock","paper","scissors"];`

The game can be seperated into 3 different functions
1. [Computer Move](#Computer-Move)
2. [A Single Round of Play](#A-Single-Round-of-Play)
3. [The Loop of the Game](#The-Loop-of-the-Game)


### Computer Move
